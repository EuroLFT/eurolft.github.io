Welcome to EuroLFT,
a body representing the European Lattice Field Theory community
(formerly EuroLAT).
We study fundamental physics via
numerical evaluation of aspects of quantum field theories on supercomputers.
Our cutting-edge research in fundamental science requires
national and EuroHPC-JU High Performance Computing resources.

A new generation of calculations is needed to meet the experimental
demand in terms of precision and to further our understanding of the
fundamental building blocks of the universe.
This can only be achieved by utilizing the next generation of supercomputers,
such as the European AI Gigafactories.

One of our objectives is to interact with European entities,
such as EuroHPC-JU,
and organizations,
such as CERN,
to give our European research community a voice and represent its interests.
