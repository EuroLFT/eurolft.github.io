**Lattice 2025**,
the annual international conference on lattice field theory,
brings together the global lattice community to present the latest advances in
algorithms,
theory,
and high-performance computing,
and their impact on particle,
nuclear,
and beyond-the-Standard-Model physics.
The conference features plenary and parallel sessions covering lattice QCD,
lattice gauge theories,
phenomenology,
and emerging computational methods,
with strong connections to current and future experimental programmes.

The conference will take place in Mumbai in November 2025.
Further information,
to be followed by all conference material,
including slides,
posters,
and recorded talks,
is publicly available on
[The Lattice 2025 Indico](https://indico.global/event/14504/).
