We are pleased to announce progress in defining
the European representative institution for the Lattice community.
Following the voting procedure concluded in May 2025,
a board was established,
with the aim of keeping it as open and inclusive as possible.

The [newly elected board (May 2025)][people] includes 16 members.

For efficiency,
the board has also elected a [smaller executive board (June 2025)][people].

The first task already accomplished was
the identification of a new name for the community representation:
EuroLFT.

Several additional tasks are currently in progress.
The board has begun working on the priorities identified during the town hall meeting in Odense (April 2025),
including:

- Preparation of a strategic community white paper
- Establishing links with European institutions
- Renewed efforts to strengthen [our web presence][website]
- [Definition of board governance, including rotation periods][governance]

You are invited to join [our new mailing list][mailing-list],
which will serve as the official communication channel.
