In April 2025,
the inaugural meeting of the organisation that would become EuroLFT was held.
This included presentations from the main European lattice collaborations
on their current activities and what they would look for from EuroLFT,
and open discussion on the next steps in forming EuroLFT.

The meeting was co-located with
a meeting of the European [Latfor Data Grid (LDG)][ldg] the following day.

The full agenda and presentation materials are [on Indico][indico]
(_currently offline_).

EuroLFT is grateful to [Syddansk Universitet][sdu],
[DIAS][dias],
and the [Carlsberg Fondet][carlsberg]
for their hospitality.
